Start research into how logins will work (spring-boot-security is a good place to start)
    OTPs via SMS or email is the way to go

    BE: Use spring-security logins and JWTs
        Look into refresh tokens
        Encode userId into JWT 
            use to validate all incoming requests
            use to derive userInfo for data models

    FE: implement authStore in pinia so all components can share auth state
            Start with welcome page, so we can welcome by name
        Stub of authStore in-place
        basic flow ->   onMount check store for token and userInfo, 
                    if null push to login page, else show component
                    
        setup axios to add token to all calls
        add error handling for 403s to redirect to login

    UserInfo {
        userId,
        sms,
        email,
        contactPreference
    }
