implement EventTracker
    Combine EventTracker and EventCreator such that we can search for and use/edit existing events or create new events from one form.
        If existingEvent, pull and autofill all fields, then disable all fields except tags and date
        else create event then create eventInstance
        Implement tag creation/editing similar to https://vueschool.io/articles/vuejs-tutorials/building-a-tag-input-component-with-the-vue-3-composition-api/
        Implement searchAhead for eventTitle similar to https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue3-simple-typeahead
            - searching works
            - still need to write fetch onSelect
